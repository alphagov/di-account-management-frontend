# Storing Architectural Design Records (ADRs) within our repo

## Summary

We will store ADRs within the `/docs` folder of this repository. These will log the architectural choices we have made, why, and consequences.

We'll do this for the same reasons stated in detail in [di-account-management-backend#31](https://github.com/alphagov/di-account-management-backend/pull/31), see there to know more.
